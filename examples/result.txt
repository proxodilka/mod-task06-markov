stuck In my head
I can't escape this hell again
Nobody's pain
stops making me play
it will go on till find the way
Wanna feel your hair
It’s hard to say
Taking my hand
Taking my hand
Stay taking my hand
Wanna feel your hair
It’s hard to say
Taking my hand
Taking my hand
Taking my hand
Stay taking my hand
Wanna feel your pain as well
Just give me your hand
It stucks In my head
I can't escape this hell again
Nobody's pain
stops making me play
it will go on till find the way
Wanna feel your hair
It’s hard to say
Taking my hand
Taking my hand
Taking my hand
Taking my hand
Stay taking my hand
Never been your darling
And I had no rays
Many things that’s matter
But it always fades
Crying makes you better
Tears are falling down
I can’t forget That’s all
I hear you now
